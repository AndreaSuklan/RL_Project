# PRESENTATION CHECKLIST
- Say **where** are in the usual graph with model knowledge and observability with the algorithms we use.
- Define our algorithms:
    - model free: what does it mean?
    - what kind of approximations they use?
    - do they bootstrap?
    - define the error 
    - on policy VS off-policy: what does it mean? 
- Make a story for the problems:
    - DQN unstable: why? How did we try to solve it? Did we succeed?
    - Moving target problem: in theory and in our environment specifically.
