# RL_Project

At the moment we have a simple simulation of the game "Hill Climb Racing" and a placeholder model not written by us.
The objective is to try different RL algorithms in order to compare and discuss the results.

For running the training simply run the script race.py, for only visualize the already trained model run visualize.py
